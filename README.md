Hello all, 

I believe that one of the best and (easy!) way to contribute to Open Source is to :

- Learn how to use Git : Good version control practicies allows us to innovate with our code without the fear of loosing our precious work and (time!).

- Lear how to use GitHub : In order to share your code with others. 

- Teach other developers how to use Git and GitHub: I know that there are a lot of developers way smarter than I am out there.
I also believe that teaching other developers how to make good code available to the general public is in deed making a contribution to the Open Source movement.

If you have a little time and are interested in scratching the surface and find out how can your code be shared to make a difference this repo is for you!

Enjoy!

God bless.

Lionel
